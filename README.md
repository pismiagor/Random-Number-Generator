# Random-Number-Generator
# The method used for creating random numbers involves coding a program that generates a number which depends on the time the program is run.
# The function called percentageCalculator is used as a test case to show the distribution (percentage) of randomly generated numbers.
# A method that includes a while loop is used to enhance the randomness of number generation.
